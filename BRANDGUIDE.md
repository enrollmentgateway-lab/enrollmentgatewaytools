# Brand guide shorthand

Working notes for the Gateway Seminary 2026 rebrand, distilled from
`brand-assets/brandguide/BrandGuidelines_Gateway.pdf` plus what we learned
rolling it out across the portal. Source PDF and raw assets live outside
this repo, at `C:\Users\CadeMacritchie\Desktop\brand-assets\` (see "Asset
paths" below).

## Rollout status

| Page | Status |
|---|---|
| `analytics/index.html` (Portal Analytics) | New brand, permanent (no toggle) |
| `index.html` (homepage) — header, hero, tab bar | New brand, permanent |
| `index.html` — Reports tab (Funnel Overview, Teaching Sites, Regional Campus Portal, Event Effectiveness, Public Event Registrants) | New brand |
| `index.html` — Tools tab (BetterQuery, Record Lookup, Slate Idea Box) | New brand |
| `index.html` — Training Materials tab (Slate Concepts) | New brand |
| `tools/queryomatic/index.html` (BetterQuery) | New brand |
| `tools/student-lookup/index.html` (Record Lookup) | New brand |
| `tools/idea-box/index.html` (Slate Idea Box) | New brand |
| `training/slate-concepts/` (Slate Concepts lesson) | Current brand, unchanged |
| The 5 report dashboards (`reports/funnel-overview/`, `reports/teaching-site-overview/`, `reports/regional-campus/`, `reports/event-tracker/`, `reports/public-event-registrants/`) | Current brand, unchanged |
| `pipeline-overview/` (not linked from the homepage) | Current brand, unchanged |

The homepage tabs were reorganized alongside the rebrand: what was "Other"
(a single report-list item) is now **Tools**, and Public Event Registrants
moved from that tab into Reports, picking up the new-brand card treatment as
card 05 since it now sits in that grid. The old `.report-list`/`.report-item`
styles were removed as dead code once nothing referenced them.

The homepage is now **fully on the new brand** — the Tools and Training
Materials cards were the last holdouts and have since been converted, so
every card in every tab shares one treatment (numbered index in Tiempos
Fine, uppercase Montserrat title over a short rust rule, gold CTA, 4px
corners, hairline `--nb-border`). Two consequences:

- The per-card `.tool-card--gs2026` variant class had no exclusions left to
  protect, so it was collapsed back into a single `.tool-card` rule and the
  HTML no longer carries the variant class.
- The current-brand card chrome it used to sit on top of — the `.tool-icon`
  emoji tiles (whose `#eef4f4`/`--gold-light`/`#eaeff5` backgrounds were
  off-palette invented tints anyway), the `.tool-card::before` accent bar,
  and the `:nth-child(3n+2)`/`(3n+3)` per-card accent colors — went away as
  dead code. The emoji icons were replaced by the same `01`/`02`/`03`
  numbered index the Reports cards use; numbering restarts per grid, so each
  tab counts from `01`.

All three Tools destinations are now converted too, so a card and the page
it opens match. Those three were the easy ones: like `analytics/`, each
ships its own inline `<style>` and never loads `assets/dashboard.css`, so
retheming them carried no risk to anything else.

What's left splits cleanly along that line:

- `training/slate-concepts/` is also standalone (`index.html` + `styles.css`), so it
  can be converted the same way — but staff read it as a bundled Claude
  artifact, so it also needs `node training/slate-concepts/build-artifact.js` and a
  republish to the existing artifact URL (see README).
- The 5 report dashboards all share `assets/dashboard.css`. Converting them
  means migrating the shared stylesheet's tokens rather than editing 5 pages,
  which also re-themes `pipeline-overview/` — so decide that page's fate as
  part of the same change.

Started as an analytics-only toggle test; both the toggle and the "test"
framing are gone now — these are live, one-way changes. When extending the
rollout to another page, follow the scoping pattern in "Rolling this out to
a shared page" below so pages/cards that should stay on the current brand
actually do.

## Current (production) brand — unchanged (where still in use)

Defined in `assets/dashboard.css`, shared by every dashboard page that
hasn't been moved to the new brand yet. Nothing on the homepage still
renders in this brand.

| Role | Hex |
|---|---|
| Navy | `#132a46` |
| Navy mid | `#244663` |
| Teal | `#087c78` |
| Gold | `#d2a53e` |
| Ink (body text) | `#1b2636` / `#203247` (varies by page) |
| Muted | `#5d6b7b` |
| Border | `#dce4e7` |
| Canvas | `#f2f5f6` |

Fonts: Georgia/Playfair Display (headings), Inter (everything else).

## New brand (2026 refresh) — 7 approved colors only

From the brand guide's color palette page. **Don't invent tints/shades —
these 7 are the entire approved palette.** A fabricated lighter teal is
what caused the "blue bars" bug on the analytics test page — always map
new-brand roles onto one of these exact hexes.

| Name | Hex | RGB | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Black | `#0c0f14` | 12,15,20 | Primary dark surface (`--navy`) |
| White | `#ffffff` | 255,255,255 | — |
| Teal | `#234048` | 35,64,72 | Accent / secondary dark surface |
| Rust | `#c44329` | 196,67,41 | Error/warning color |
| Gold | `#d3a422` | 211,164,34 | Accent |
| Gray-blue | `#708aa2` | 112,138,162 | Accent (stat #3 marker) |
| Dark gray | `#2c343a` | 44,52,58 | Secondary dark surface / body ink |

Avoid multi-hue gradients between two of these swatches (e.g. teal →
gray-blue) — even though both are approved colors individually, blending
them reads as an off, muddy color rather than "the brand teal." Prefer flat
fills; the analytics chart bars are flat `var(--teal)` under the new brand
for this reason.

### Shape language — slight rounding, not pill-shaped

The live marketing site (gs.edu, e.g. `/academics/`) uses square-ish
buttons/cards with just a slight corner radius (see reference screenshot:
"Find Your Program" / "Request Info" buttons — a few px, not fully sharp
and nowhere near the current portal's pill-shaped controls). That's a
deliberate departure from the current portal, which leans on pill-shaped
controls and 13–16px rounded corners everywhere. The new brand should
carry that subtler, squarer language over — not zero radius, just small.

Implemented as a radius scale, uniformly reduced under the new brand:

| Var | Current brand | New brand | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--radius-sm` | `9px` | `4px` | Form controls (date-range select) |
| `--radius-stat` | `13px` | `4px` | Stat cards |
| `--radius-panel` | `14px` | `4px` | Panels, brand-toggle pill |
| `--radius-lg` | `16px` | `4px` | Hero/intro card |
| `--radius-bar` | `4px` | `4px` | Chart bar top corners |

Any new rounded element should route through one of these vars (or a new
one following the same pattern) rather than a hardcoded `border-radius`,
so it inherits the sharp-corner treatment automatically under the new
brand.

### Divider lines — short accent rules, not full-width borders

Reference screenshots: `C:\Users\CadeMacritchie\Desktop\brand-assets\gs.edu
example images\`. gs.edu repeatedly breaks up sections with a short (~40px),
thin (2–3px) horizontal rule in an accent color, instead of a full-width
border:

- An eyebrow label flanked by two short rules on either side — `— ACADEMICS —`.
- A short rule directly under a big serif headline, before the body copy.
- A short rule under a card's subheading (gold on dark cards, rust on white
  cards), replacing what would otherwise be a full-width `border-bottom`.

Implemented on the analytics page:

- `.intro::after` — already existed pre-rebrand; the hero card's short gold
  rule under the heading. Already brand-aware via `var(--gold)`, no change
  needed.
- `.page-title` (header eyebrow) — under the new brand, gains flanking
  `::before`/`::after` rules in `var(--gold)`, matching the "— ACADEMICS —"
  treatment.
- `.panel-head` — under the new brand, its full-width `border-bottom` is
  dropped in favor of a short `var(--red)` (rust) rule under the `h2`,
  matching the white-card examples.

When adding a new section header, prefer this short-rule pattern for the
new brand over a full-width border — pick gold on dark surfaces, rust on
white ones, matching what's above.

### Fonts (three-tier system)

1. **Heading** — Tiempos Fine VF (Klim Type Foundry). We only have the free
   **Test Fonts** build (`brand-assets/fonts_tiempo/Test*.otf`) — per Klim's
   standard Test Fonts EULA that's normally evaluation-only, not licensed for
   production/public use. Gateway's team confirmed these are the test files;
   if that changes, swap in the real purchased OTFs and reconvert (see
   "Self-hosting a new weight" below). Self-hosted now as WOFF2 in
   `assets/fonts/TiemposFine-{Regular,Semibold,Bold}.woff2`.
2. **Subheading** — Montserrat (Google Fonts, free). Section titles, panel
   headings, table headers, small-caps labels.
3. **Body** — Open Sans (Google Fonts, free). Paragraphs, table cells.

Don't let anything fall back to Inter/Playfair by omission — if an element's
`font-family` isn't explicitly set, it silently inherits `body`'s font
rather than picking the right tier. Check explicitly.

## Implementation notes

### Standalone pages (analytics/index.html)

This page ships its own full inline `<style>` block — it doesn't load
`assets/dashboard.css` — so every color/font/radius is just a plain CSS
custom property at `:root`. No scoping tricks needed; it's the only brand
on the page.

- `[hidden]` needs an explicit `display:none !important` rule in this page's
  inline stylesheet. Any class that sets its own `display` (`.grid`,
  `.state`, etc.) beats the browser's default `[hidden]{display:none}` rule
  in the cascade, so `element.hidden = true/false` in JS silently does
  nothing without it. (Already present in `assets/dashboard.css:35` for
  every other dashboard — this page just didn't have its own copy.)
- Watch specificity when a `.utility-class` (e.g. `.number`) is applied to
  an element that also needs a tag-level default (e.g. `th`): the class
  wins over the type selector even if the type selector comes later, so
  `th.number` needed its own explicit override.

### Recurring calls when converting a tool page

The three Tools pages hit the same handful of questions the palette doesn't
answer outright. How they were settled, so the next page matches:

- **A state needs a light tint and the palette has none.** The 7 swatches are
  all mid-to-dark, so there is no light teal/amber to fill a chip or an
  active state with. Use an **outlined** treatment instead — transparent or
  white fill, 1px border and text in the accent. That's how the Idea Box
  status chips (`.status-badge`), its voted state (`.vote-btn.voted`),
  BetterQuery's zero-result notice (`.panel.notice`), and Record Lookup's
  highlighted profile fields (`.field.feature`) all read.
- **A control needs a hover/active step darker than its base.** There's no
  approved darker teal or gold, so step to the brand **black** rather than
  inventing a shade — see `button.primary:hover` (Idea Box) and
  `#primaryBtn:hover` (BetterQuery).
- **More semantic states than accents.** Idea Box has 5 idea statuses against
  4 accents, so it spends them as a progression and leaves the untriaged one
  neutral: new → `--muted`, planned → gold, in progress → gray-blue,
  done → teal, declined → rust.
- **Monospace is functional, not brand type.** BetterQuery's `options.md`
  editor keeps JetBrains Mono; the three-tier system governs prose, not a
  code field. Same reasoning for Record Lookup's stamp, which stays Courier.
- **Representational elements survive the rebrand.** Record Lookup draws an
  application as a printed document — stacked sheets, a ruled margin, a
  rubber stamp. That's an illustration of a thing, not brand chrome, so it
  kept its shape and only changed materials: brand neutrals (`--paper`,
  `--line`) for the cream-and-amber paper, and a rust stamp. Don't flatten a
  device like that into a plain panel just to land on-palette.
- **Pages embedded in Slate get no GS header.** BetterQuery and Record Lookup
  are served inside the Slate portal's own chrome at
  `enroll.gs.edu/portal/...`, so they deliberately have no wordmark/eyebrow
  header of their own. Idea Box, which is served standalone from Pages, does
  get the full header treatment.

### Rolling this out to a shared page (index.html and beyond)

`index.html` (the homepage) loads the shared `assets/dashboard.css`, and
reuses its classes (`.gs-header`, `.page-intro`, ...) — the same classes
every other dashboard page depends on for its *current*-brand look. The
homepage itself no longer has any excluded elements, but the rule below is
what keeps the *other* pages safe, and it's the pattern to follow on the
next shared page you convert. **Never redefine `assets/dashboard.css`'s shared
`--navy`/`--teal`/`--gold`/`--border`/`--radius`/etc.**, even by adding a
`:root` override further down a page's own stylesheet — those vars cascade
to every element using them on that page, including ones you didn't mean to
touch (this is exactly how the then-excluded BetterQuery/Record Lookup cards
could accidentally have ended up re-themed).

Instead:

1. Define a **namespaced** set of custom properties (prefixed `--nb-`, for
   "new brand") scoped to a container class that only exists on the elements
   you're actually changing — `.hub { --nb-black:#0c0f14; ... }` on
   `index.html`, since `<body class="hub">` is unique to that page.
2. Write override rules using `var(--nb-*)`, addressed with enough
   specificity to beat the shared rule (a `.hub .gs-header { background:
   linear-gradient(120deg, var(--nb-black), var(--nb-darkgray)); }` beats
   `assets/dashboard.css`'s bare `.gs-header` rule because two classes beat
   one, regardless of file order).
3. For an excluded element that shares a base class with elements you ARE
   changing, add a second, distinguishing class instead of touching the base
   class, and put every new-brand rule behind that, never behind the bare
   base class. The excluded elements then render from the untouched base
   rules exactly as before, with zero risk of drift. (The homepage did this
   with `.tool-card--gs2026` while its Tools/Training cards were excluded;
   once they were converted the variant was folded back into `.tool-card`.
   Retire the variant class the same way when a page's last exclusion goes —
   a variant guarding nothing is just a second name for the base.)

This is slower to write than a blanket `:root` override, but it's the only
way to guarantee an excluded page or card is actually unaffected — verify by
grepping the file for the shared var names (`--navy`, `--teal`, `--gold`,
`--border`, `--radius`) outside of comments after making changes; none of
your new rules should reference them.

## Self-hosting a new weight/format

```bash
python -m pip install fonttools brotli
python -m fontTools.ttLib.woff2 compress -o out.woff2 in.otf
```

Then add an `@font-face` block and reference the family in the relevant
`--font-*` var. Keep `font-display: swap`.
